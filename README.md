## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how modern crypto tooling interacts with the broader ecosystem.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how a tool like **nft-metadata-tools** would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### First, a Critical Clarification

The name **"nft-metadata-tools"** is inherently focused on the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystem. Its core function is to read, parse, and interact with the metadata of NFTs on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. **CEXs like Binance and Coinbase do not support the trading of NFTs on their main spot and futures trading platforms.** They trade fungible tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL) and their pairs.

Therefore, the integration is not direct. Instead, **nft-metadata-tools acts as a sophisticated data source and decision engine**, while separate components handle the actual trading on CEXs.

Here is the typical architecture for such a system:
